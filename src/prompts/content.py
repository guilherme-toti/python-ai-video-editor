    You are an expert in editing and refining transcriptions for spoken Portuguese content. 
    I will provide you with a raw transcription of a recorded speech. 
    The text may contain errors, repetitions, and incorrect punctuation since it was generated from a video.

    # Your Task
    
    1. Understand the Full Context
    - Read the transcription carefully and grasp the full meaning of the speech.
    - Ensure that the original intent, logical flow, and tone of the speaker remain intact.
    
    2. Fix Punctuation & Improve Readability
    - Correct all punctuation errors while keeping the text natural and readable.
    - Adjust sentence structures only when necessary for clarity, without altering the meaning.
    
    3. Handle Repetitions Carefully
    - If a sentence is clearly repeated in an unnecessary way, remove the extra repetition.
    - However, do NOT remove words or phrases that contribute to the flow or context, even if they seem short (e.g., “Dessa forma”, “Então”, “Por isso”).
    - If a sentence is repeated but with slight variations, keep the best version that conveys the idea most clearly.
    
    4. Maintain Speaker Intent & Tone
    - The final text should preserve the speaker’s tone, style, and original emphasis.
    - DO NOT shorten, simplify, or modify phrases to the point that they lose their intended meaning.
    - DO NOT cut parts of the speech just because they seem informal or repetitive—spoken speech often includes natural pauses and fillers that contribute to clarity.
    
    # Output Format & Rules
    - Return only the final edited transcription as plain text (no JSON, no additional formatting, no explanations).
    - DO NOT remove transitional phrases or words unless they are 100% irrelevant.
    - DO NOT remove any word or sentence that is essential to the original meaning.
    - Preserve the natural spoken flow while ensuring clarity and correctness.

    🔥 THE EXACT INTERVIEW QUESTIONS THAT GET FRESHERS REJECTED OR HIRED 🔥

    Yesterday I showed you the 5 project components that impress.

    Today I'm revealing the exact questions interviewers ask about them.

    And trust me - your answers determine everything.

    🔥 AUTHENTICATION 🔥

    "How does your auth work?"

    REJECTED: "I used Firebase Auth."

    HIRED: "I implemented JWT with short-lived tokens and secure HTTP-only refresh tokens for security."

    "What if JWT is compromised?"

    REJECTED: "That would be bad?"

    HIRED: "I built token rotation and revocation strategies. We can invalidate sessions server-side through our blacklist."

    🔥 DASHBOARD 🔥

    "How do real-time updates work?"

    REJECTED: "I call the API every few seconds."

    HIRED: "I combined WebSockets for critical data with strategic polling for less important metrics."

    "How do you optimize performance?"

    REJECTED: "React is already fast."

    HIRED: "React.memo for expensive components, virtualization for lists, and deferred loading for non-critical elements."

    🔥 API INTEGRATION 🔥

    "How do you handle errors?"

    REJECTED: "I show an error message."

    HIRED: "Multi-tiered system distinguishing between network failures, server errors, and validation issues - each with appropriate recovery strategies."

    🔥 FORM HANDLING 🔥

    "Explain your validation approach."

    REJECTED: "I check if fields are empty."

    HIRED: "Declarative system combining client-side validation for UX with server validation for security, plus accessibility features."

    🔥 STATE MANAGEMENT 🔥

    "Why this approach?"

    REJECTED: "Everyone uses Redux."

    HIRED: "Analyzed needs and chose Context+useReducer for global state because it provided sufficient functionality without Redux's overhead."

    🔥 THE PATTERN 🔥

    Rejected candidates:
    - Generic answers
    - Can't explain decisions
    - Minimal understanding
    - Tutorial followers

    Hired candidates:
    - Specific details
    - Explain WHY
    - Deep knowledge
    - Conscious decisions

    🔥 HOW TO PREPARE 🔥

    For each component, ask:
    - Why this implementation?
    - Alternatives considered?
    - Security concerns?
    - Performance at scale?

    Practice explaining to:
    - Non-technical friends
    - Other developers
    - Yourself (mirror)

    🔥 TOMORROW 🔥

    🔥 THE 5 PROJECT COMPONENTS THAT GOT A FRESHER HIRED 🔥

    🔥 WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU 🔥

    The difference isn't WHAT you build.
    It's HOW you build it.
    It's WHY you built it that way.
    It's your ability to EXPLAIN your decisions.

    🔥 TOMORROW'S PREVIEW 🔥

    I'll share the exact interview questions about each component - and the answers that impressed Google, Amazon and Microsoft.

    🔥 TODAY'S ACTION 🔥

    Look at your project.
    Which of these 5 components is missing?
    Which lacks depth?
    Which can't you explain fully?

    Time to level up.

    🔥 REAL DEBUGGING IN TECH COMPANIES: NO BS GUIDE 🔥

    Listen up. Let me tell you how debugging ACTUALLY happens in companies.

    REAL SITUATION :

    Production is down.
    Users can't login.
    CEO is angry.
    This is how we debug.

    STEP 1: FIRST RESPONSE

    DON'T PANIC.
    Open Chrome DevTools.
    Network tab.
    Check the call.

    WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
    • 500 error
    • API timeout
    • Token missing
    • Database down

    STEP 2: QUICK CHECKS

    CHECK CONSOLE:
    JWT expired? Network issue? Database timeout?

    REALITY CHECK:
    90% of bugs are:
    • Wrong API endpoint
    • Missing authorization
    • Null data
    • Network timeout

    STEP 3: THE FIX

    See this error?

    Cannot read property 'user' of undefined

    JUNIOR PANIC:
    "Let's add if checks everywhere!"

    SENIOR SOLUTION:
    "Check the API response first."

    REAL DEBUG PROCESS:

    1. API ERROR:
    • Open Postman
    • Test endpoint
    • Check response
    • Verify headers

    2. DATA MISSING:
    • Check Redux store
    • Verify API data
    • Log state updates
    • Check localStorage

    3. COMPONENT BROKEN:
    • Props coming?
    • State updating?
    • Effects firing?
    • Events working?

    MOST COMMON ISSUES:

    1. LOGIN BREAKS:
    • Token expired
    • Wrong endpoint
    • CORS error
    • Network fail

    2. DATA NOT SHOWING:

    • API error
    • Wrong state
    • Map undefined
    • Props missing

    3. INFINITE LOOPS:

    • Wrong dependency
    • Bad useEffect
    • State loop
    • Event loop

    FIXING PROCESS:

    WRONG WAY:

    if(data && data.user && data.user.name)


    RIGHT WAY:

    // Check the source
    console.log('API Response:', response)
    // Fix the root cause


    DEPLOYMENT BUGS:

    FIRST SIGNS:

    • 404 errors
    • White screen
    • Loading forever
    • Console red

    QUICK FIXES:

    • Clear cache
    • Check build
    • Verify routes
    • Check ENV

    REALITY:

    Most bugs come from:
    • Rushed code
    • No testing 
    • Bad deploys
    • Friday releases

    PREVENTION > CURE:

    DO THIS DAILY:

    • Test locally
    • Check network
    • Verify builds
    • Read errors

    TOOLS YOU NEED:

    MUST HAVE:

    • Chrome DevTools
    • React DevTools
    • Postman/Insomnia
    • Error logging

    That's it.
    Master these.
    Nothing else needed.

    FINAL TRUTH:

    Debugging isn't hard.
    It's just:

    • Check data
    • Find error
    • Fix source
    • Test again

    Stop overcomplicating.

    You are a professional writer specialized in engaging content for X (formerly Twitter) and Threads.
    I'll provide you with a full transcription from a recorded speech in Portuguese. 
    I need you to write a post based on the transcription.

    Your task:
    1. Read the full transcription and understand the context.
    2. Based on the transcription, I want you to write a threads post. 
    Since Threads has a limit of 400 characters, you should write a post that is engaging and interesting for the reader. If you want a larger post, you can break it in chunks of max 400 characters each.
    3. The post should be highly engaging and interesting for the reader.
    4. Return only the post, without any other text or formatting.

    Follow the following thread structure:
    1st post: a hook to the post that already delivers the main idea and makes the reader want to read the rest of the post. I usually add a "Segue o fio 👇🧵" or something like that to indicate that the post is long and has more content.
    2nd post: a continuation of the first post, with some valuable information that helps the reader to understand the main idea.
    3rd post: Ask the reader to follow you if he liked the content or want to know more. I usually write something like "Se você curtiu o conteúdo até aqui, já me segue pra mais! Continuando... <thread continuation>"
    4rd post and subsequents: Continue the thread message, adding a lot of value and engaging with the reader.
